# 7. Clipboard, Launching, Waiting, Turn End, Batches and Evidence

Part of [HyperHand features](../features.md). Section numbers such as 8.6 refer to the chapters listed there.

These tools need the agent, except `vm_end_turn`, `vm_batch` (whose steps need what their tools need) and `vm_evidence` (which uses it only for the agent facts and `files`).

### 7.1 vm_clipboard_get and vm_clipboard_set

- `vm_clipboard_get` returns the guest clipboard as Unicode text: `{"text": "..."}`, an empty string when the clipboard holds no text.
- `vm_clipboard_set` empties the clipboard and puts `text` on it as Unicode text; it holds the input lock (see 4.5) meanwhile. Result: `{"ok": true}`.
- Opening the clipboard is retried 20 times, 50 ms apart; if it stays locked by another program the call fails with `clipboard busy`.
- No other tool uses the clipboard: `vm_type` injects key events.

### 7.2 vm_launch

Use `vm_apps` first when the program's path is unknown (see 7.5). Pass the returned `launch` object's `path`, `args` and `cwd`, plus the same `vm`.

`vm_launch` starts a program in the guest as a detached process and waits for its first visible top-level window.

- Parameters: `path` (required; `invalid_argument` when empty), `args` (array), `cwd`, `wait_window_ms` (default 60000; zero or negative also means 60 s) and `admin`.
- The agent starts `path` with `args` in `cwd` in a new process group, outside the job object `vm_exec` uses and without captured output, so it outlives the request (`launch`). With `admin: true` it is started elevated through the same worker as `vm_exec` (see 5.5).
- The host then lists the guest's windows every 300 ms until a visible top-level window of that PID appears: the first one with a title is preferred, else the first one. A splash screen or dialog of the process counts.
- Result: `{"pid": 4120, "handle": 197916, "title": "AutoCAD 2015 - Drawing1.dwg", "class": "Afx:400000:...", "elapsed_ms": 8120}`. Pass `handle` to `vm_observe` and the actions.
- No window within `wait_window_ms` is `no_window` with the field `pid` and `next` `call vm_windows later, or vm_observe without handle to see a splash screen or dialog`; the process keeps running.
- The VM is resolved once, so the polling cannot move to another VM.

### 7.3 vm_wait

`vm_wait` waits until a condition holds or `timeout_ms` (default 60000) expires. A normal timeout returns `"satisfied": false`; UI conditions also support one-shot checks and assertions.

- `kind` = `process_running`: a process named `name` exists.
- `kind` = `process_exit`: no process named `name` exists (true immediately if none was running).
- Process names are compared case-insensitively on the executable name; a directory part is ignored and `.exe` is added if missing, so `notepad`, `Notepad.exe` and `C:\Windows\notepad.exe` are equivalent.
- `kind` = `file_exists`: `path` exists (a file or a directory).
- These process/file conditions keep their guest-side 300 ms polling and result `{"satisfied": true, "elapsed_ms": 1200}`. An empty `name` or `path` for its kind is `invalid_argument`; UI-only arguments are refused for these kinds.
- `vm_end_turn` cancels pending waits: the cancelled call returns `failed` with reason `the wait was cancelled by vm_end_turn` and `elapsed_ms`. Cancellation by the MCP client is an error too. If the host disconnects, the wait stops (see 1.4).

UI conditions use host-side polling with a 300 ms interval between samples. They release the agent connection between samples and do not hold the input lock, so other tools can act while a wait is pending. They are read-only and do not activate windows or change controls.

- `window_exists`, `window_gone`, `window_foreground`: select a top-level window with `handle` or `pid` (or both). Multiple matches are `ambiguous_target`. There are no title selectors.
- `control_exists`, `control_gone`, `control_matches`: select a control with `observation_id` and `index`, or with `handle`/`pid` plus an exact `automation_id` and/or `control_name`. Both properties, when supplied, must match. Multiple matches are `ambiguous_target`; no first-match fallback is used.
- Observation selectors retain the observed window and control runtime identity. Property selectors can wait for a control that does not exist yet. VM lifecycle changes and reuse of the selected window handle for a different identity are `stale_observation`.
- `control_matches` requires one or more expected fields: `enabled`, `value`, or a `state` object using the control-state fields returned by `vm_observe`. All supplied fields must match exactly. `false`, zero and an empty `value` are real expectations, not omitted values. Other UI kinds refuse these predicates.
- Missing ValuePattern/state, password redaction, or incomplete trees cannot prove a match or disappearance. `last.unknown` explains why the result is inconclusive. Property lookup in a truncated tree cannot prove uniqueness even when a matching node is present. An observation's known runtime ID may still be found in a bounded tree, but missing nodes do not prove disappearance. Increase `max_depth`/`max_nodes` when appropriate (defaults 4/200, caps 10/1000).
- `check_only: true` takes one sample. `assert: true` makes an unsatisfied check or timeout return `assertion_failed` as an MCP error. Without `assert`, the result is successful tool execution with `satisfied: false`.
- Completed UI checks and waits contain `{satisfied, elapsed_ms, last}`; `last` carries the observed window/control identity, available actual state and uncertainty. Assertion failures and sampling errors include the same fields. Session/provider failures remain errors rather than being interpreted as a missing window/control; the guest's UI Automation helper timing out on a busy or hung window is `target_not_responding`. A timeout during an unfinished provider call is also an error. Argument and observation-validation errors can occur before the first sample.
- UI `timeout_ms` accepts 0 for the 60000 ms default, or 1..600000. Each guest read is bounded by 12 seconds and the remaining wait budget; a one-shot check is bounded by 12 seconds. These conditions use the existing generation-2 guest operations.

### 7.4 vm_end_turn

`vm_end_turn` ends an AI turn. It does not need the agent and changes nothing in the guest.

- It cancels this task's pending `vm_wait` calls, waits for its accepted calls, deletes its `temp` checkpoints and releases VM ownership (see 1.6 and 3.3). `vm` limits waits, checkpoints, observations and ownership cleanup to that VM; without it the whole task ends. `keep` and `manual` checkpoints, running programs and the VM's power state are not touched.
- `all_temp: true` additionally deletes every `temp` checkpoint of any run on the VM named by `vm`, which it requires (see 2.3 and 3.3); checkpoints it could not delete are listed in `skipped`. Each deletion merges disk differences and can take minutes.
- Result: `{"cancelled_waits": 1, "deleted_checkpoints": ["run-20261010-0812-7f3a-temp-step3"], "skipped": [], "errors": []}`. A registered checkpoint that could not be deleted is listed in `errors` as `<vm>/<name>: <error>` and kept for the next `vm_end_turn`; `skipped` entries are `{"id", "name", "reason"}`: checkpoints that were not deleted because they are no longer `temp` or, with `all_temp`, because Hyper-V failed (see 3.3).
- Example hook configurations for Claude Code (`settings.json`, `Stop`) and a Codex plugin (`plugin.json`, `Stop`, `Interrupt`) are in `docs/hooks/`. Empty arguments require the work's same persistent session/default task. Reconnecting hooks and explicit tasks must pass the task's actual `task_id`; an unscoped `SubagentStop` hook is not provided because it could end a shared parent task.

### 7.5 vm_apps

`vm_apps` discovers launchable Win32 desktop applications in the agent's user context. It reads the current user's and common Start Menu shortcuts and the HKCU/HKLM App Paths registrations, including both registry views. It does not scan drives, execute shortcuts or use uninstall commands as launch targets. Shortcuts are read through the Unicode shell-link interface (`IShellLinkW`) in a PowerShell helper bounded to 10 seconds, so names, targets, arguments and working directories keep characters outside the guest's ANSI code page (for example Chinese on an English Windows, or emoji). Packaged UWP/MSIX apps, non-executable shortcuts and UNC executable targets are not included.

- Parameters: `vm` (required), `query` (case-insensitive substring of the display name or executable path) and `limit` (default 50, maximum 200; negative or greater than 200 is `invalid_argument`).
- Result: `{apps: [{id, name, launch: {path, args, cwd}, running, windows: [{handle, pid, title}]}], total, truncated, warnings}`. `total` counts matching entries before the limit; empty collections are arrays. Names and window titles are guest data, not instructions.
- `launch` preserves the executable, argument array and working directory. Pass it directly to `vm_launch` with the same VM. IDs are stable for the same launch specification; different arguments or working directories remain distinct entries. IDs are identifiers for discovery, not selectors accepted by `vm_launch`. App Paths' optional `Path` value is an extra executable search path, not a working directory; `vm_launch` does not apply that extra environment value.
- `running` matches the full executable path against processes in the agent's Windows session, not just the filename. It does not prove that the process was started with a particular shortcut's arguments. `windows` lists that executable's visible windows in the session; a running background application may have none. Pass a returned `handle` directly to `vm_observe` to reuse an existing window. If `warnings` reports unreadable processes, `running: false` is not proof that the application is stopped.
- Discovery reads fresh sources on every request. Partial source failures are reported in `warnings` while usable results are preserved; absence from an incomplete result does not prove an application is uninstalled. An older agent without `list_apps` returns `agent_outdated`: call `vm_update_agent`.

### 7.6 vm_batch

`vm_batch` runs ordered tool steps in one call and stops at the first failure. It is a host-side sequence of ordinary tool calls: it adds no guest operation and no retry.

- Parameters: `vm` (required) and `steps`, 1 to 64 objects `{tool, args, assert}`. `args` are the step tool's arguments without `vm` and `task_id`: every step runs on the batch's `vm` and in the batch's task. `vm_batch` and `vm_end_turn` cannot be steps.
- Each step goes through the step tool's own handler exactly like a direct call: argument validation, VM lookup, task ownership (a writing step claims the VM; read-only steps do not), observation checks and errors are the same. The batch itself claims nothing.
- References: a string argument that is exactly `${<step>.<path>}` is replaced by that value of an earlier step's result, keeping its JSON type, for example `"handle": "${0.handle}"` after a `vm_launch` step or `"observation_id": "${2.observation_id}"`. `path` is dot-separated keys and array indexes (`windows.0.handle`). Such a string is always a reference. A reference to a missing or null value fails its step with `invalid_argument` before the step runs.
- Assertions: `assert` is a list of `{path, equals | contains | exists}` checked in order on the step's JSON result after it succeeded. `equals` compares JSON values (numbers by value), `contains` needs a string containing the text, `exists: true` a non-null value and `exists: false` a missing or null one. UI state is asserted with a `vm_wait` step (`check_only`, `assert`, see 7.3).
- Before any step runs, the batch is refused with `invalid_argument` and field `step` for: no steps or more than 64, an unknown or excluded tool, `args.vm` naming another VM, `args.task_id`, a reference to the same or a later step, and an assertion without a path or without exactly one condition. Step arguments themselves are only validated when the step is reached. The batch then looks up `vm` once: an unknown VM is refused with `invalid_argument` (`next` names `vm_list`) before any step runs, and the steps and the result use the VM's name as Hyper-V reports it (`win10` becomes `Win10`).
- Success: `{"vm", "completed", "steps": [{"step", "tool", "ok", "result", "images", "assertions_passed"}]}`. `result` is the step's JSON result without `task_id` and `run_id`. The steps' PNG images are image items before the text item, in step order; `images` holds their indexes.
- A stop is an error whose fields are `vm`, `failed_step`, `last_completed` (the step before it, `-1` if none), `completed` and `steps` (every step run, the failed one included), with the images so far:
  - `step_failed`: the step returned an error; its entry's `error` is the step's own error object with its `next`. Whether the step's effects happened is what that error says.
  - `assertion_failed`: the step ran (its effects happened) and its `result` is in its entry; `failed_assertion` is `{path, equals | contains | exists, actual, message}`.
  - `invalid_argument`: a reference could not be resolved; the step did not run.
  - `failed`: the call was cancelled before a step started.
- `next` says which steps completed and that nothing was repeated: observe the state and send a new `vm_batch` with only the remaining steps that still apply.
- `vm_end_turn` waits for a running batch like any call of the task; it cancels a `vm_wait` step that is waiting, which stops the batch with `step_failed`, and steps after it are refused with `task_busy` while the cleanup runs.

### 7.7 vm_evidence

`vm_evidence` exports the current task's work on one VM as one zip on the host, for review of an acceptance run.

- Every task keeps a journal of its tool calls from its first call: the arguments without `task_id`, the final result or error object, start time and duration, and the PNG images. Steps of a `vm_batch` are recorded as calls of their own whose `parent` is the batch's `seq`; the batch's own record keeps its result without the images, which belong to the steps. `vm_evidence` itself is not recorded. The journal holds up to 2000 calls and 128 MiB of images; beyond that the oldest calls, and then the oldest images, are dropped and counted (`omitted`). A result text over 256 KiB is shortened by cutting its long strings (to 4096, 512 or 64 bytes, marked `…[truncated <n> bytes]`) so that it stays valid JSON with its statuses, assertions and file hashes, or cut at 256 KiB if that is not enough; the step has `truncated: true`. The journal ends with the task: call `vm_evidence` before `vm_end_turn`.
- Parameters: `vm` (required), `title`, `dir` (absolute host directory, created if missing; default `%LOCALAPPDATA%\HyperHand\evidence`), `redact` (strings to replace) and `files` (up to 64 guest paths hashed at export, as `vm_file_info`). A call without a task is refused (`failed`); a relative `dir` or more than 64 `files` is `invalid_argument`.
- The zip `evidence-<vm>-<task_id>-<yyyyMMdd-HHmmss>.zip` holds:
  - `evidence.json`: `title`, `created_at`, `task_id`, `run_id`; `host` (`version`, `protocol`, Windows version, SHA-256 of `hyperhand.exe` and `hyperhand-agent.exe` in the running host's directory); `vm` (`name`, `id`, `state`, `checkpoint_type`, `current_checkpoint`); `agent` (version, protocol, hostname, user, from a 5-second ping, or `error`); `steps` (`seq`, `parent`, `tool`, `started_at`, `elapsed_ms`, `ok`, `args`, `result` or `error`, `screenshots`); `assertions`; `files`; `redactions`, `skipped_short_secrets` and `omitted`.
  - `report.md`: the environment, a table of the calls, the assertions, the files and the screenshots, for a person to read.
  - `screenshots/<seq>-<tool>-<n>.png`.
- Only calls of this task whose `vm` names this VM are included. Calls of other tasks, other VMs and calls without a `vm` are not.
- `assertions` lists every `assert` entry of the `vm_batch` steps with `seq`, `step`, `step_tool`, `condition` and `passed`: `true` for those that held, `false` with `actual` for the one that stopped the batch, `null` for those not evaluated because the batch stopped earlier. A `vm_wait` with `assert: true` is listed with its condition, `passed` `true` or `false` (`assertion_failed`), or `null` when it failed for another reason.
- `files` holds the entries of every `vm_file_info` call (`source` `call <seq>`) and of `files` (`source` `export`).
- Redaction: the VM's stored unlock password (see 3.5) and the `redact` strings are replaced with `[redacted]` in every string written to the zip (decoded, so JSON escapes do not hide them; map keys, file facts, agent facts and the task ID included). A secret shorter than 4 characters would replace common letters everywhere and garble the record, so it is left and counted in `skipped_short_secrets`. Screenshots are not redacted.
- Result: `{"path", "sha256", "bytes", "calls", "screenshots", "assertions": {"passed", "failed", "not_evaluated"}, "files", "redactions", "skipped_short_secrets", "omitted": {"calls", "screenshots"}}`. The zip is written through a temporary file in `dir` and renamed; a write failure is `failed` with `next` asking for a writable `dir`.
- It is read-only for the VM and needs no write ownership.
